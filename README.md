# PassWizard!
Password Generator - Strong and unique passwords at the push of a button! 

The purpose of this project is to build the code for a password generator.  Making use of Alerts, Prompts and Confirmations, the user is asked to make certain decisions on what parameters the randomized password should be built within.

The users input is then used within the proceeding code to deliver a constantly unique, super strong, randomized password for them to use.
